1. how to trigger the event
The event (lightning strike) should be triggered by a mouse click from the user.

2. what should happen when the event is triggered
When the event is triggered, a lightning strike should spawn, affecting all blocks in a 7 nearest possible points in a diagonal line.
The effected blocks show an entity (lightning strike) and change the blocks to a "burnt grass" like block.
Any Dude (full or not full) should turn into the Entity called FairyHunter.
And the Hunter destroyer spawns on random x y throughout the world bounds.

3. what the affected entities should do
The FairyHunter Entity should turn hostile (from dude to FairyHunter) and target the Fairy Entities.
A few hits from adjacent tiles should remove the fairies.

4. what the new entity is and how it should behave
The HunterDestroyer should target the Fairy Hunters (once they exist) and attempt to destroy them.
One is spawned every lightning strike at a random position.

5. what each partner contributed if applicable
